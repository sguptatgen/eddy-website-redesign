# EDDY-Website-Redesign
This repo contains the full source code for the redesign of the site for "EDDY: Evaluation of Dependency Differentiality." Developed by Shrey Gupta at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in 2015.

# How to Use Template
This repository is bundled with a generalized template for use on other TGen Biocomputing websites. In order to use the template, you must transfer the `template.html` file to your working directory, along with the following all assets except for `assets/scripts/index.js` and `assets/scripts/index.css`.

# Browser Compatibility
Given the dependencies used by this website, the website should be able to run perfectly in Microsoft IE8+, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. IE7 is supported with minor style bugs.
